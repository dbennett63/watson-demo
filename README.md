# watson-demo

## Overview
The demo will consist of a high level review of existing demo applications available on IBM's Watson service site. As time permits, we will deep dive into the Personality Service. The advanced prerequisites are if you want to follow along, and likely require some familiarity with using a terminal in Windows or Mac. I tested this on a Mac, so it may vary slightly if you are using windows.

If you run into issues getting through either prereq, please reach out to me prior to class.

Feel free to peruse the [available Watson services](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/watson/services) ahead of time.

   11. Execute the following command to test:
   `./personalityCurl.sh "username-from-step-8" "password-from-step-8" "../data/sample-text.txt"`
   12. Validate output file output-datetimestamp.json is generated in execution folder. This contains json of the personality analysis results.

  Simple curl command in /script/ to hit Watson personality service API with a given username, password, and file. Outputs response json to execution directory in file "output-<datetimestamp>.json"
