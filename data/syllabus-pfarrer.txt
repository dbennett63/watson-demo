COURSE DESCRIPTION 

Strategic management is about competitive advantage and performance. Why does one firm perform better than another? How can a firm maintain its competitive advantage over time? Specifically, this course focuses on how managers can develop and implement effective business-level and corporate-level strategies through external (industry-level) and internal (firm-level) analyses. It is an integrative course emphasizing a “general management” perspective as opposed to a functional viewpoint (e.g., accounting, finance, or marketing). 

This course requires you apply the skills, analyses, and tools you’ve previously learned. It is primarily case-based, discussion-oriented, and participatory in nature. 

COURSE OBJECTIVES

The course is designed to help students:
•	Become familiar with theories, concepts and models that managers can use to develop and implement successful strategies, specifically: 
o	To analyze the internal and external environments of the firm through a SWOT analysis and its underlying components
o	To understand the types and implementation of business-level and corporate-level strategies as well as their benefits and drawbacks
o	To understand the benefits and drawbacks of strategic implementation vehicles (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, takeovers, alliances, restructuring, FDI)
o	To understand the function of corporate governance in a public corporation

•	Improve their understanding of business as well as their communication skills through class discussions, written analyses, and formal presentations. 

PRE-REQUISITES 

None. 

UNIVERSITY HONOR CODE & ACADEMIC HONESTY POLICY 

As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University’s academic honesty policy, “A Culture of Honesty,” and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in “A Culture of Honesty” found at: www.uga.edu/honesty. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.

Academic Misconduct. Academic honesty requires the course work (drafts, reports, examinations, papers) a student presents to an instructor honestly and accurately indicates the student's own academic efforts.  If you have questions as to what counts as academic misconduct, the Guide to Academic Misconduct can be found at: http://www.uga.edu/honesty/ahpd/sect13.htm 

Academic dishonesty of any form will result in no less than a grade of zero for the assignment in question and could well result in a failing grade for the entire course.

STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND PERFORMANCE ISSUES

If you have a health, work, or other related issue that may adversely impact your attendance and/or performance, please see me promptly to discuss potential accommodations. 

If you plan to request accommodations for a disability, please register with the Disability Resource Center at 114 Clark Howell Hall (706.542.8719).

CHANGES TO THE SYLLABUS

This is a dynamic setting. The professor reserves the right to revise this syllabus and the course calendar, if necessary.

REQUIRED COURSE MATERIAL

Rothaermel. Strategic Management (3rd ed.). (ISBN: 978-1-259-42047-4)

Additional readings may be posted on the website or distributed in class. 

TEAM SELECTION

Teams should consist of 4-5 students and be finalized before the end of the first week of class. Please also sit with your group during class. This aids in class discussion.

Team Guidelines

I encourage you to be proactive if you are experiencing problems with your group. I also expect you to resolve conflicts on your own. However, concerns that cannot be handled internally should be brought to my attention immediately. 

I will, upon written-petition of all other team members, allow teams to “fire” an individual from the team. Individuals that have been fired will have the opportunity to solicit a new position from another team. If another team does not hire a fired individual (teams are under no obligation) the fired individual’s score for the group project portion of the course grade will be zero.

ASSIGNMENTS & GRADING

Group case presentation			 25%	
Group conference call				 25%				
Class participation	 	 		 15%
Peer evaluation			 	 10%
Final report					 25%	

Grading Logic:

When grading your assignments, I use a rubric in order to allocate points to specific features of the assignment (see below) as well as to provide you specific feedback. I also make a holistic assessment as to whether your deliverable exceeded, met, or failed to meet the content and quality of an “average” deliverable I have received over the last dozen years teaching similar courses. In this way, you should consider grades between 90 and 100 as “exceeding” my expectations, between 80 and 89 as “meeting” my expectations, and grades below 80 as “failing to meet” my expectations of the content and quality of an average deliverable. 

Grading Scale:	
			A	93.00 and above
A-	92.99-90.00  
B+	89.99-87.00
B 	86.99-84.00 
B-	83.99-80.00
C	70.00-79.99
D	60.00-69.99
F	59.99 and below

Your final grade will be a weighted average of the assignments listed above. If there is a curve, it will occur at the end of the semester. Any grades you receive during the semester will not be curved. Please note that I do not “round grades up.” For example, a final grade of 89.50 or 89.99 will receive a B+. 

Please also note that I do not 1) accept extra credit, 2) accept late assignments, or 3) reschedule due dates except for university-sponsored absences. Late assignments will result in a 0 score unless the student provides a documented excuse for his or her absence. If the excuse is acceptable, the student’s final grade may be reweighted and recalculated by omitting the missed assignment/exam.

Grade Appeals

Any appeals of grades must be done in writing within 48 hours of receiving a grade.  Upon receiving a written grade appeal, I will review the merits of the appeal and re-grade the exam/paper in light of these comments. Thus, your new grade may be higher or lower than the original grade. 

Please also note that I will not deliberate or negotiate grades via e-mail. If you wish to discuss your grade, please first provide the written appeal as described above. If necessary, I will schedule a face-to-face or phone appointment to resolve the issue. 

Group Case Presentation (25%)

In addition to the case write-up, each group will present a case to the class.  Please note that not all group members need present. Two or three are sufficient.

Please note that I do not consider your participation in presenting a case as part of your individual participation grade.

I have provided guidelines below. Further guidance will be provided throughout the term.

Group Conference Call (25%)

Each group will present its findings and preliminary recommendations during an assigned Distance Week. The presentation may in the form of a scheduled conference call or video conference. Please note that not all group members need present. Two or three are sufficient.

Please note that I do not consider your participation in the conference call as part of your individual participation grade.

I have provided guidelines below. Further guidance will be provided throughout the term.

Class Participation (10%)

Please expect to attend and be well prepared for each class, having completed the assignments ahead of time. If all class members prepare for and actively participate, we will all learn more from each other and enjoy the course more. 

This is an interactive, dynamic setting. Students will be expected to participate individually and in teams. To that end, please sit with your team during class. If you are absent, please notify the instructor ahead of time as a courtesy. You are responsible for any missed material and for any assignments due on that day. 

Your individual participation grade consists of your participation in the following:
1.	Discussion of In the News or other material to start each class
2.	Case discussion as part of an assigned group
3.	Overall participation in class Q&A from lectures, presentations, and guest speakers

Please note that the above does not include being a presenter on a group conference call and/or case presentation. These are group grades and thus presenters do not receive more or less credit than non-presenters.

Please also note that the participation grade is not an attendance grade, although consistent attendance is naturally required for the opportunity to participate. Like with your group assignments, I take active notes on your daily participation, but I also make a holistic assessment of your overall participation during the semester, relative to my expectations of an “average” participator and the participation of your classmates.

Thus, if you receive a score between 90 and 100, I found your participation good to exceptional. If you received a score between 80 and 89, I found your participation average to good. If you received a score between 70 and 79, I found your participation below average. If you received a score below 70 (0-69), I found your participation poor. Please also note that I take attendance and noted participation during every class in order to be as accurate as possible in my assessment, compare my assessment to the participation grade you give yourself, and generally give you the benefit of the doubt, i.e., give you the highest grade rationally possible. To that end, since this was a participation, and not an attendance grade, a 0 score, or any score below 70, is defensible. Please keep that in mind when viewing your participation grade. That is, the possible range is from 0-100, not 70-100.

Finally, I realize that you are working professionals and many of you may miss class for work-related reasons. If you miss class for any reason, please let me know on your participation worksheet. Excused absences must be in line with the university’s guidelines and include health and religious reasons. For work absences, not all absences are valid, but I will consider each of them on a case-by-case basis.  

Further guidance will be provided throughout the term.


Peer Evaluation (10%)

Finally, it is expected that all group members will contribute equally to group assignments. I will administer a peer evaluation at the end of the semester to assess your group members’ appraisals of your contributions, including your attendance and participation in class. Late evaluations will result in a 0 score for the evaluator.

Group Report (30%)

Each group will write an approximately 20-page, double-spaced report that analyzes 1 key strategic issue facing a firm of your choice, but one not discussed in detail in class. Your analysis will take the form of a consulting report, complete with all appropriate background and situational analyses, as well as future recommendations. Your key issues should be directly related to course topics and discussion.

The paper will be due in electronic copy (by e-mail) at the end of the term.

I have provided guidelines below. Further guidance will be provided throughout the semester.
